# Tech_Run: A Classic Platform Game

I've created a platform game called "Tech_Run" using Pygame. The game features 10 levels with increasing difficulty, where you'll
navigate through platforms, collect coins, and avoid obstacles.

## Game Features

• 10 progressively challenging levels
• Coin collection system to track your score
• Health system that decreases when hitting obstacles
• Simple but effective shape-based graphics
• Level completion flags to progress through the game

## How to Play

### Prerequisites

Before you can play Tech_Run, you'll need:
• Python 3.x installed on your computer
• The Pygame library

### Installation

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Install Pygame using pip:

   pip install pygame

3. Run the game:

   python tech_run.py


### Controls

• **Left Arrow**: Move your character left
• **Right Arrow**: Move your character right
• **Space**: Jump (you can only jump when on a platform)
• **Escape**: Quit the game
• **R**: Restart the game after game over or completion

### Gameplay Instructions

1. You control a blue square character
2. Navigate through each level by jumping on green platforms
3. Collect yellow coins to increase your score
4. Avoid red obstacles - they will decrease your health
5. Reach the purple flag at the end of each level to progress
6. Complete all 10 levels to win the game
7. If your health reaches zero or you fall off the screen, it's game over

### Level Progression

The game starts simple but gets progressively more challenging:
• Level 1: Basic platforms and coins to get familiar with controls
• Level 2-3: Introduction to obstacles and more complex layouts
• Level 4-6: More challenging jumps and strategic obstacle placement
• Level 7-9: Complex platform arrangements requiring precise timing
• Level 10: The ultimate challenge with minimal platforms and maximum obstacles

The code is now ready in your directory. Enjoy playing Tech_Run!
